About Jakarta Security
-------------

Jakarta Security defines a standard for creating secure Jakarta EE applications in modern application paradigms.
It defines an overarching (end-user targeted) Security API for Jakarta EE Applications.

Jakarta Security builds on the lower level Security SPIs defined by Jakarta Authentication and Jakarta Authorization,
which are both not end-end targeted.
