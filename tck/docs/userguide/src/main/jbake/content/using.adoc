5 Executing Tests
-----------------

The {TechnologyShortName} TCK uses the JavaTest harness to execute a set of
tests in the test suite. For detailed instructions that explain how to
run and use JavaTest, see the JavaTest User's Guide and Reference in
the documentation bundle.

This chapter includes the following topics:

* link:#GBFUZ[Starting JavaTest]
* link:#GBFWM[Running a Subset of the Tests]
* link:#GCLRR[Running the TCK Against your selected CI]
* link:#GCLRZ[Running the TCK Against a Vendor's Implementation]
* link:#GBFVK[Test Reports]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The instructions in this chapter assume that you have installed and
configured your test environment as described in
link:install.html#GBFTP[Chapter 3, "Installation,"] and
link:config.html#GBFVV[Chapter 4, "Setup and Configuration,"],
respectively.

=======================================================================

ifdef::rebuild[]
As explained in link:rebuild.html#GCLIZ[Appendix B, "Packaging the
Test Applications in Servlet-Compliant WAR
Files With VI-Specific Information,"] the {TechnologyShortName} TCK
introduces the concept of repackaging the TCK tests.

[[GBFUZ]][[starting-javatest]]

5.1 Starting All Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended to run the {TechnologyShortName} TCK 
from the command line in your shell environment


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The `mvn` command referenced in the following
two procedures and elsewhere in this guide is the Apache Maven
build tool, which will need to be downloaded separately.
The `build.xml` file in `<TS_HOME>/bin` contains the various Ant
targets for the {TechnologyShortName} TCK test suite. Ant commands can 
be run via maven using maven-antrun-plugin. 

=======================================================================

5.1.1 To Start All tests in Command-Line Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

include::using-examples.inc[]

[[GBFWM]][[running-a-subset-of-the-tests]]

5.2 Running a Subset of the Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following modes to run a subset of the tests:

* link:#GBFWK[Section 5.2.1, "To Run a Subset of Tests in Command-Line Mode"]

[[GBFWK]][[to-run-a-subset-of-tests-in-command-line-mode]]

5.2.1 To Run a Subset of Tests in Command-Line Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Change to the directory containing the tests you want to run.
2.  Start the test run by executing the following command: +
+
[source]
----
mvn verify
----
+
The tests in the directory and its subdirectories are run.

[[GCLRR]][[running-the-tck-against-the-ci]]

5.3 Running the TCK Against another CI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some test scenarios are designed to ensure that the configuration and deployment of
all the prebuilt {TechnologyShortName} TCK tests against one Compatible
Implementation are successful operating with other compatible implementations, and that the TCK is ready for
compatibility testing against the Vendor and Compatible Implementations.

1.  Verify that you have followed the configuration instructions in
link:config.html#GBFVU[Section 4.1, "Configuring Your Environment to Run
the TCK Against the Compatible Implementation."]
2.  If required, verify that you have completed the steps in
link:config.html#GCLIW[Section 4.3.2, "Deploying the Prebuilt Archives."]
3.  Run the tests, as described in link:#GBFUZ[Section 5.1, "Starting
JavaTest,"] and, if desired, link:#GBFWM[Section 5.2, "Running a Subset
of the Tests."]

[[GCLRZ]][[running-the-tck-against-a-vendors-implementation]]

5.4 Running the TCK Against a Vendor's Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This test scenario is one of the compatibility test phases that all
Vendors must pass.

1.  Verify that you have followed the configuration instructions in
link:config.html#GCLHU[Section 4.2, "Configuring Your Environment to
Repackage and Run the TCK Against the Vendor Implementation."]
2.  If required, verify that you have completed the steps in
link:config.html#GCLIL[Section 4.3.3, "Deploying the
Test Applications Against the Vendor Implementation."]
3.  Run the tests, as described in link:#GBFUZ[Section 5.1, "Starting
JavaTest,"] and, if desired, link:#GBFWM[Section 5.2, "Running a Subset
of the Tests."]

[[GBFVK]][[test-reports]]

5.5 Test Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A set of report files is created for every test run. These report files
can be found in the report directory you specify. After a test run is
completed, the JavaTest harness writes HTML reports for the test run.
You can view these files in the JavaTest ReportBrowser when running in
GUI mode, or in the web browser of your choice outside the JavaTest
interface.

To see all of the HTML report files, enter the URL of the `report.html`
file. This file is the root file that links to all of the other HTML
reports.

The JavaTest harness also creates a `summary.txt` file in the report
directory that you can open in any text editor. The `summary.txt` file
contains a list of all tests that were run, their test results, and
their status messages.

[[GBFWD]][[creating-test-reports]]

5.5.1 Creating Test Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the following modes to create test reports:

* link:#GBFVC[Section 5.5.1.1, "To Create a Test Report in Command-Line Mode"]

[[GBFVC]][[to-create-a-test-report-in-command-line-mode]]

5.5.1.1 To Create a Test Report in Command-Line Mode
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Specify where you want to create the test report.
a.  To specify the report directory from the command line at runtime,
use:
+
[source]
----
ant -Dreport.dir="report_dir"
----
+
Reports are written for the last test run to the directory you specify.
2.  To specify the default report directory, set the `report.dir`
property in +{jteFileName}+. +
For example:
+
[source]
----
report.dir="/home/josephine/reports"
----
+
3.  To disable reporting, set the `report.dir` property to `"none"`,
either on the command line or in +{jteFileName}+. +
For example:
+
[source]
----
ant -Dreport.dir="none"
----
+

5.5.2 Viewing an Existing Test Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the following modes to view an existing test report:

* link:#GBFWB[Section 5.5.2.1, "To View an Existing Report in
Command-Line Mode"]


[[GBFWB]][[to-view-an-existing-report-in-command-line-mode]]

5.5.2.2 To View an Existing Report in Command-Line Mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use the Web browser of your choice to view the `report.html` file in the
report directory you specified from the command line or in +{jteFileName}+.
